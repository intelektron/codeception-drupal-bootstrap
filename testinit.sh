# To run the tests for this package, we need a working installation of Drupal. Drupal has already been downloaded as a
# dev dependency, but we still need to install it. I've also made the very unlikely assumption that you don't have
# Drush installed. We use the locally managed version of Drush to install the Composer managed Drupal installation using
# an SQLite database.

# Tl;dr - We install Drupal with an sqlite database for testing.

# The command to get the site installed is already long anough as it is, this also makes it quicker to change if I ever
# have to.

# @todo wget and install Drupal 7/9
